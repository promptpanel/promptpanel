Simplified OpenAI chat agent for getting started.

Includes default configuration settings for using OpenAI's GPT-4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 models (defaults to GPT-3.5 if an invalid model is entered).

For all options available for chat, we recommend using the **LLM - Chat** plugin which has all the options available for configuring your chat experience.
