Simplified Cohere chat agent for getting started.

Includes default configuration settings for using Cohere's Command R and Command R+ models (defaults to Command R if an invalid model is entered).

For all options available for chat, we recommend using the **LLM - Chat** plugin which has all the options available for configuring your chat experience.
