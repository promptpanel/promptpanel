Simplified Anthropic chat agent for getting started.

Includes default configuration settings for using Anthropic's Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus models (defaults to Haiku if an invalid model is entered).

For all options available for chat, we recommend using the **LLM - Chat** plugin which has all the options available for configuring your chat experience.
